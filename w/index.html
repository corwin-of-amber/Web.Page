Given a high-level specification and a low-level programming language, our goal is to automatically
synthesize an efficient program that meets the specification. In this paper, we present a new
algorithmic methodology for inductive synthesis that allows us to do this.</p>
<p>
We use Second Order logic as our generic high level specification logic.  For our low-level
languages we choose small application-specific logics that can be immediately translated into code
that runs in expected linear time in the worst case. </p>
<p>
We explain our methodology and provide examples of the synthesis of several graph classifiers, e.g,
linear-time tests of whether the input graph is connected, acyclic, etc.  In another set of
applications we automatically derive many finite differencing expressions equivalent to ones that
Paige built by hand in his thesis.  Finally we describe directions for
automatically combining such automatically generated building blocks to synthesize efficient code
implementing more complicated specifications.</p>
<p>
The methods in this paper have been implemented in Python using the SMT solver Z3.</p>

<p>
We describe a framework that combines deductive, numeric, and inductive
reasoning to solve geometric problems.  Applications include the generation of
geometric models and animations, as well as problem solving in the context of
intelligent tutoring systems.</p>
<p>
Our novel methodology uses (i) deductive reasoning to generate a partial program from logical
constraints, (ii) numerical methods to evaluate the partial program, thus creating geometric models
which are solutions to the original problem, and (iii) inductive synthesis to read off new
constraints that are then applied to one more round of deductive reasoning leading to the desired
deterministic program. By the combination of methods we were able to solve
problems that each of the methods was not able to solve by itself.</p>
<p>
The number of nondeterministic choices in a partial program provides a
measure of how close a problem is to being solved and can thus be used in the educational context for grading and providing hints.</p>
<p>
We have successfully evaluated our methodology on 18
Scholastic Aptitude Test geometry problems, and 11 ruler/compass-based
geometry construction problems. Our tool solved these problems using an
average of a few seconds per problem.</p>
